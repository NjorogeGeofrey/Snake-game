# Snake-game
Remember the snake game in the old nokia phones? well this project aims to create a similar game using python only.

## Snake Game
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game is designed to be simple and engaging, allowing players to control a snake as it navigates a grid, eating food to grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail.

## Features
Real-Time Snake Movement: The snake moves in real-time based on player inputs, with smooth directional changes.
Food Consumption: The snake grows in length each time it consumes food, and the score increases accordingly.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions with walls and the snake's own tail, causing the game to reset when these occur.
Score Tracking: A scoreboard tracks the player's score, which increases as the snake consumes more food.

## Project Structure
main.py: This is the entry point of the game, where the game loop is initialized and managed.
snake.py: Contains the Snake class that manages the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection.
food.py: Contains the Food class that handles the creation and random placement of food on the screen.
scoreboard.py: Contains the Scoreboard class that manages score display and updates.

# Final output.
